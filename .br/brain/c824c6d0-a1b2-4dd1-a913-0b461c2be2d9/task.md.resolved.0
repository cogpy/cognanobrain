# Chapter 7: Integrated Human Brain Model Implementation

## Goal
Implement the complete time crystal brain architecture as specified in DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md Chapter 7.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Structures
- [ ] **7.1** Create 5-sensory prime mapping
  - [ ] Map each sense (visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, gustatory) to prime sequences
  - [ ] Add cross-modal integration support

### Phase 2: Memory System
- [ ] **7.2** Implement 12 memory carrier types
  - [ ] Define `MemoryCarrier` enum and `MemoryCarrierSystem` class
  - [ ] Implement carrier-specific encoding/decoding

### Phase 3: Decision Architecture
- [ ] **7.3** Build H3 decision device
  - [ ] Three-layer decision architecture
  - [ ] Confidence-weighted voting mechanism

### Phase 4: Brain Regions
- [ ] **7.4** Create brain region simulators
  - [ ] Implement Cerebellum, Hippocampus, Hypothalamus modules
  - [ ] Add connectome integration

### Phase 5: Consciousness Expressions
- [ ] **7.5** Implement 20 conscious expressions
  - [ ] Map 12 dodecanion + 8 octonion states
  - [ ] Expression recognition/generation

## Verification
- [ ] Run unified_demo to test integration
- [ ] Verify brain model metrics in output
