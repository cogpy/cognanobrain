# Chapter 5: Universal Time Crystal & Big Data Implementation

## Overview
Implement Chapter 5 features from the NanoBrain book: "Garden of Gardens" (GOG) meander flower architecture with nested time crystals, TC transform engine, and Gödel incompleteness handling.

## Tasks

- [x] **5.1 Garden of Gardens (GOG) Structure**
  - Created `nanobrain_gog.h/.cpp`
  - Implemented nested time crystal hierarchy with GOGNode
  - Added meander phase calculations and coherence/resonance

- [x] **5.2 Time Crystal Transform Engine**
  - Created `nanobrain_tc_transform.h/.cpp`
  - Implemented prime-based signal analysis
  - Added image/audio analysis modes and FFT comparison

- [x] **5.3 "Search Without Searching" Mechanism**
  - Created `nanobrain_spontaneous.h/.cpp`
  - Implemented pattern registration and synchronization
  - Added prime-based encoding and resonance detection

- [x] **5.4 Turing-Failure Scenarios**
  - Created `nanobrain_turing_tests.h/.cpp`
  - Implemented 10 Turing failure test cases with fractal solutions
  - Documented approaches for each undecidable problem

- [x] **5.5 Hardware Architecture Simulation**
  - Created `nanobrain_hardware_sim.h/.cpp`
  - Thermal breathing model with phase-based temperature modulation
  - Microtubule dynamics with tubulin states and resonance network

## Status
- Phase: Complete ✅
- Progress: 5/5 modules implemented
- CMakeLists.txt: Updated
