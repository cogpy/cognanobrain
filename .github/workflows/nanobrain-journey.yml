          **Chapter ${{ needs.roadmap-analysis.outputs.current_chapter }} Implementation**
          
          This automated implementation focuses on:
          
          ### Chapter ${{ needs.roadmap-analysis.outputs.current_chapter }} Features:
          - Progressive consciousness modeling enhancements
          - Theoretical framework implementation
          - Incremental feature development
          
          ### Implementation Details:
          - **Automated by**: NanoBrain Journey workflow
          - **Date**: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
          - **Focus Area**: Chapter ${{ needs.roadmap-analysis.outputs.current_chapter }} of the 10-chapter roadmap
          - **Branch**: ${{ env.BRANCH_NAME }}
          - **Workflow Run**: ${{ github.run_id }}
          - **Merge Strategy**: Enhanced with unrelated histories support
          
          ### Merge Conflict Resolution:
          This implementation includes enhanced merge conflict resolution:
          - ‚úÖ Support for unrelated histories (--allow-unrelated-histories)
          - ‚úÖ Progressive fallback strategies (rebase ‚Üí merge ‚Üí manual resolution)
          - ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling and logging
          - ‚úÖ Stash/restore workflow for local changes
          
          ### Next Steps:
          - Review implementation quality
          - Test consciousness modeling improvements
          - Merge for continued roadmap progression
          
          *This PR is part of the systematic NanoBrain Journey implementation plan with enhanced merge conflict resolution.*
